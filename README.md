There are 3 examples of coding homework that I enjoyed, and felt proud of.

One of the questions was how to answer the question of FizzBuzz.  Create a program
to count to 100 that returns "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3, "Buzz" if the number is
multiple of 5, and "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of both 3/5.



Another challenge that I enjoyed was defining the class People, and getting them to return with
a specific phrase.


Another challenge I thoroughly enjoyed was the first hackathon that we did where we were tasked to
produce a tip calculator that prompted the user how much of a % they would like to tip, followed by asking the user if they wanted the check to be split or not.
